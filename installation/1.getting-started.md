## MAD Server Setup
Its basically just setting up a Database and fill in the MAD config.

There is currently only a guide for Linux, but PRs for a Windows Documentation is welcome.

### Ubuntu/Debian

DISCLAIMER: This whole article assumes a fresh installed [Ubuntu 18.04 Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server), located in the same network as your phones. There may be some difference to your setup. Please keep that in mind!
#### MySQL/MariaDB
You need a Database with full permissions. That DB can be located on a different Server, but needs to be accessible by your MAD server. It does not matter if you are using MariaDB or MySQL, but no other Database-system is supported. 
>If you are plan to use [PMSF](https://github.com/whitewillem/PMSF) as a webfrontend: use at least MySQL 8 or MariaDB 10.2 or higher! 

##### Install MariaDB on your Server:
```bash
apt update
apt install mariadb-server
mysql_secure_installation
```
>If you not sure about the questions asked in `mysql_secure_installation`, just press enter for each question ;) 

Log in to your Database and create an dedicated user for MAD, if you don't know how to, take a look at [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql).

They are two supported Database Schemas: **Monocle** and **OSM-Rocketmap**, a [fork](https://github.com/cecpk/OSM-Rocketmap) to support OSM map titles.  
If you want to use Monocle, create an empty database and import [this schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitewillem/PMSF/master/sql/cleandb.sql) like this:
```bash
mysql -u root -e "create database MonocleDB;"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitewillem/PMSF/master/sql/cleandb.sql | mysql -u root MonocleDB 
```

If you want to use the Rocketmap schema, install python2.7, setup Rocketmap as a webserver only and launch it for the first time. It will create the the tables automatically if you create the database itself before. Follow the guide from the [official Rocketmap documentation](https://rocketmap.readthedocs.io/en/develop/basic-install/index.html), but **make sure to clone the [OSM-Rocketmap](https://github.com/cecpk/OSM-Rocketmap) fork** instead of the normal one.
```
python2.7 runserver.py -os
```
Rocketmap can act as a webfrontend as well. See [webfrontends](/extras/webfrontends) for more informations.

And finally, grant permissions for your dedicated MAD database user to the database you've just created:
```SQL
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASENAMEHERE.* TO 'DATABASEUSERHERE'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
Now you are ready to setup the MAD server itself.
#### Python
Since Ubuntu 18.04 does comes with a pre-installed python3.6 version but without a pip3 installation, run this command to install it:
```bash
apt install python3-pip
```
Make sure you have the right version installed, since even if python3.6 is installed, the `python3` command could still point to `python3.5` or below!
Check if `pip` and `python` is installed correctly by running:
* `python3 --version` - should return `3.6.x`
* `pip3 --version` - If it returns a version, it is working.


#### MAD/PIP Packages
Next Step is to clone this repository and install all the required pip packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD.git
```

Change into in the directory of MAD and run:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
>If you are encountering the error `Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1`, make sure you have the apt package `default-libmysqlclient-dev` installed.  

>If you want to use OCR to scan raids **or** scanning for Quests, run with `requirements_ocr.txt` and install additional packages: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr python-opencv`

### Windows
ffs i dont know, tell me
#### MAD Config
Copy the example config file and rename it to `config.ini`:
```
cp configs/config.ini.example configs/config.ini
```
>The article [Config File](config-file.md) has more detailed descriptions about the available options.  

Populate the config with at least the database configuration, runtype and the Pogoassets path.  
The runtype is depending on the mode you want to use. OCR or MITM (learn more about this topic [here](/scanning-modes/modes.md)). If you want to use the MITM mode, uncomment `only_scan`. For OCR start two instances, one with `only_scan` and the other one with `only_ocr` and `ocr_multitask`.  
The Pogoassets are necessary as well. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/ZeChrales/PogoAssets/) somewhere on your server and fill in the full path of it. For example: `pogoasset: /home/mad/PogoAssets`

Every other config option is optional and not needed for the first start.

#### Mappings
The next step is to configure the mappings.json (located in configs/mappings.json). This file is responsible to "map" your phones to walkers and walkers to areas. The easiest way to configure that is via the MAD webfrontend, MADmin. Start it with:
```
python3 configmode.py
```
MADmin will run on http://localhost:5000/. Go to `Mapping Editor` and start with adding an area. The type is depending on what do you want to scan. Every type and option of it has a description explaining itself.

Have a look at [Mappings](mappings.md) to understand how this works.


#### Running
If everything is set up correctly, you can start MAD:
```
python3 start.py
```
